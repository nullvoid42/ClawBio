# NutriGx Advisor — Personalised Nutrition from Genetic Data

**Skill ID**: `nutrigx-advisor`  
**Version**: 0.1.0  
**Status**: MVP  
**Author**: ClawBio Community  
**Requires**: Python 3.11+, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, reportlab (optional)

---

## What This Skill Does

The NutriGx Advisor generates a **personalised nutrition report** from consumer
genetic data (23andMe, AncestryDNA raw files or VCF). It interrogates a curated
set of nutritionally-relevant SNPs drawn from GWAS Catalog, ClinVar, and
peer-reviewed nutrigenomics literature, then translates genotype calls into
actionable dietary and supplementation guidance — all computed locally.

**Key outputs**
- Markdown nutrition report with risk scores and recommendations
- Radar chart of nutrient risk profile
- Gene × nutrient heatmap
- Reproducibility bundle (`commands.sh`, `environment.yml`, SHA-256 checksums)

## Algorithm

### 1. Input Parsing (`parse_input.py`)

Accepts:
- 23andMe `.txt` (tab-separated: rsid, chromosome, position, genotype)
- AncestryDNA `.csv`
- Standard VCF (extracts GT field)

Auto-detects format from header lines. Normalises alleles to forward strand using
a hard-coded reference table (avoids requiring external databases).

### 2. Genotype Extraction (`extract_genotypes.py`)

For each SNP in the panel:
1. Look up rsid in parsed data
2. Return genotype string (e.g. `"AT"`, `"TT"`, `"AA"`)
3. Flag as `"NOT_TESTED"` if absent (common for chip-to-chip variation)

### 3. Risk Scoring (`score_variants.py`)

Each SNP is scored on a **0 / 0.5 / 1.0** scale:
- `0.0` — homozygous reference (lowest risk)
- `0.5` — heterozygous
- `1.0` — homozygous risk allele

Composite **Nutrient Risk Scores** (0–10) are computed per nutrient domain by
summing weighted SNP scores. Weights are derived from reported effect sizes
(beta coefficients or OR) in the primary literature.

Risk categories:
- **0–3**: Low risk — standard dietary advice applies
- **3–6**: Moderate risk — dietary optimisation recommended
- **6–10**: Elevated risk — consider testing and targeted supplementation

> **Important caveat**: These are polygenic risk indicators based on common
> variants. They are not diagnostic. Rare pathogenic variants (e.g. MTHFR
> compound heterozygosity with high homocysteine) require clinical confirmation.

### 4. Report Generation (`generate_report.py`)

Outputs a structured Markdown report with:
- Executive summary (top 3 personalised findings)
- Per-nutrient sections: genotype table → interpretation → recommendation
- Radar chart (matplotlib) of nutrient risk scores
- Gene × nutrient heatmap (seaborn)
- Supplement interactions table
- Disclaimer section
- Reproducibility block

### 5. Reproducibility Bundle (`repro_bundle.py`)

Exports:
- `commands.sh` — full CLI to reproduce analysis
- `environment.yml` — pinned conda environment
- SHA-256 checksums of input and output files
- Timestamp and ClawBio version tag

## Usage

```bash
# From 23andMe raw data
openclaw "Generate my personalised nutrition report from genome.txt"

# From VCF
openclaw "Run NutriGx analysis on variants.vcf and flag any folate pathway risks"

# Targeted query

## Privacy

All computation runs **locally**. No genetic data is transmitted. Input files are
read-only; no raw genotype data appears in any output file (reports contain only
gene names, SNP IDs, and risk categories).

---

## Limitations & Disclaimer

1. **Not a medical device.** This skill provides educational, research-oriented
   nutrigenomics analysis. It does not constitute medical advice.
2. **Common variants only.** The panel covers SNPs with MAF > 1% in at least one
   major population. Rare pathogenic variants are out of scope.
3. **Population context.** Effect sizes are predominantly derived from European
   GWAS cohorts. Risk estimates may not generalise equally across all ancestries.
4. **Gene–environment interaction.** Genetic risk scores interact with baseline
   diet, lifestyle, microbiome, and epigenetic state. A "high risk" score does not
   mean a nutrient deficiency is present — it means the individual may benefit from
   monitoring.
5. **Simpson's Paradox note.** Population-level associations used to derive weights
   may not reflect individual trajectories (see Corpas 2025, *Nutrigenomics and
   the Ecological Fallacy*).

## Roadmap

- [ ] **v0.2**: Microbiome × genotype interaction module (16S rRNA input)
- [ ] **v0.3**: Longitudinal tracking — compare reports across time
- [ ] **v0.4**: HLA typing for immune-mediated food reactions (coeliac, gluten sensitivity)
- [ ] **v0.5**: Integration with NeoTree neonatal data for maternal nutrition risk scoring
- [ ] **v1.0**: Multi-omics integration (metabolomics + genomics + dietary recall)
