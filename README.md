## Core Principles

- **Local-first**: No genomic data leaves your laptop. No cloud uploads, no data exfiltration.
- **Reproducible**: Every analysis exports `commands.sh`, `environment.yml`, and SHA-256 checksums — anyone can reproduce it without the agent.
- **Modular**: Each skill is a self-contained directory (`SKILL.md` + Python scripts) that plugs into the orchestrator.

## Why ClawBio?

General-purpose AI agents are powerful but blind to the specific needs of biological research:

- **Privacy**: Genomic data is sensitive. Cloud-first agents risk exposing patient samples, proprietary variants, and unpublished findings.
- **Reproducibility**: Biology demands audit trails. Every analysis step must be logged, versioned, and exportable as a reproducible pipeline.
- **Domain expertise**: A generic agent does not know that a VCF file needs ancestry-aware annotation, or that single-cell data requires doublet removal before clustering.

ClawBio fills this gap with skills that understand biology from the ground up.

## Current Functionality (MVP)

### Bio Orchestrator

A meta-agent that routes natural-language bioinformatics requests to the right specialist skill. Detects file types (`.vcf`, `.fastq`, `.h5ad`) and keywords, chains multi-step analyses, and assembles final reports.

### Equity Scorer

Computes the **HEIM (Health Equity Index for Minorities)** score from VCF or ancestry data:

- Observed & expected **heterozygosity** per population
- Pairwise **FST** (Nei's GST method) between all populations
- **PCA** on the genotype matrix
- **HEIM Equity Score** (0-100) quantifying how well a dataset represents global population diversity
- Outputs: markdown report, 5 publication-quality figures (PCA plot, FST heatmap, heterozygosity comparison, ancestry distribution, HEIM gauge), CSV tables, reproducibility bundle

**Demo result**: 50 samples across 5 populations (AFR, AMR, EAS, EUR, SAS), 500 variants → HEIM Score **76.2/100** (Good). Identified EUR overrepresentation at 44% vs 16% global proportion.

### PharmGx Reporter

Generates a **pharmacogenomic report** from consumer genetic data (23andMe, AncestryDNA):

- Parses raw genetic data files (auto-detects format)
- Extracts **31 pharmacogenomic SNPs** across **12 genes** (CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, VKORC1, SLCO1B1, DPYD, TPMT, UGT1A1, CYP3A5, CYP2B6, NUDT15, CYP1A2)
- Calls star alleles and determines metabolizer phenotypes
- Looks up **CPIC drug recommendations** for **51 medications**
- Outputs: markdown report with alerts, gene profiles, complete drug table, reproducibility block

**Demo result**: Synthetic patient with CYP2D6 *4/*4 (Poor Metabolizer) → **10 drugs flagged AVOID** (codeine, tramadol, 7 TCAs, tamoxifen), 20 caution, 21 standard. Report generated in <1 second.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) installed and configured
- Python 3.11+
- Bioinformatics tools for your skill of choice (see individual SKILL.md files)

### Install a skill

```bash
# Install the Bio Orchestrator (routes to sub-skills automatically)
openclaw install skills/bio-orchestrator

# Install the Equity Scorer for diversity analysis
openclaw install skills/equity-scorer
```

### Use a skill

```bash
# Ask the orchestrator to analyse a VCF file
openclaw "Analyse the diversity metrics in my VCF file at data/samples.vcf"

# Run equity scoring directly
openclaw "Score the population diversity in data/ancestry.csv using HEIM metrics"
```

## Architecture

```
User Request
    |
    v
Bio Orchestrator (routing + file I/O + reporting)
    |
    +---> Equity Scorer (diversity metrics, HEIM index)
    +---> PharmGx Reporter (pharmacogenomic profiling, CPIC)
    +---> VCF Annotator (variant annotation, VEP)
    +---> Lit Synthesizer (literature search, summarisation)
    +---> scRNA Orchestrator (single-cell pipelines)
    +---> Struct Predictor (protein structure)
    +---> Seq Wrangler (sequence QC, alignment)
    +---> Repro Enforcer (reproducibility export)
    |
    v
Markdown Report + Audit Log + Reproducibility Bundle
```

Each skill is a standalone SKILL.md + supporting scripts. The Bio Orchestrator routes requests to the right skill based on input type and user intent, but every skill also works independently.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the full design.
